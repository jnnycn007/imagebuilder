## generic mainline linux on arm chromebook notes

- https://github.com/hexdump0815/linux-mainline-on-arm-chromebooks/blob/main/readme.md

## kernel build notes

- https://github.com/hexdump0815/linux-mainline-mediatek-mt81xx-kernel/blob/master/readme.cbm

## priority

- medium: will be worked on and improved from time to time, waiting for mainline gpu driver to get ready

## special notes

- most things seem to work more or less
- there is no gpu acceleration as there is no open source driver available for the powervr gpu in the mt8173 soc, mesa software rendering is used instead for opengl etc.
- when booting from an usb medium the bootup might hang waiting to discover the root device - in such cases it might help to shortly unplug and replug the usb medium the system is booted from
